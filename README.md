## Technologies Used

## Description

This was our first C# practice project. We made a loop that takes in an integer, compiles the numbers before and including that number into an array. The loop also checks if each list item is divisible by 3 or 5. If divisible by 3 the number would be replaced by "ping". If divisible by 5 the number would be replaced by "pong". Lastly if the number is divisible by 3 and 5 it would be replaced by "ping-pong".
